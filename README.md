# Playground_DataProjects

In Kaggle, the "Playground" refers to an interactive environment where users can experiment with datasets, code, and machine learning techniques. 
It provides a sandboxed space for users to explore, analyze, and visualize data, as well as build and test models.

I will keep the notebooks that I have prepared throughout the playground episodes in this repository.
